The Travelling Salesman Problem (often called TSP) is a classic algorithmic problem in the field of computer science and operations research[1]. It is focused on optimization. In this context better solution often means a solution that is cheaper. TSP is a mathematical problem. It is most easily expressed as a graph describing the locations of a set of nodes.
Our goal in this problem is to find the shortest path to visit all cities(points) exactly once.
